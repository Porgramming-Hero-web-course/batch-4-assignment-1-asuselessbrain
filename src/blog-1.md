**The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.**

Union and intersection types in TypeScript bring more flexibility and safety of types.

Union types (A | B) are the type of variables that can hold values of multiple types, allowing versatile functions or structures that accept varied dataâ€”for example, string | number. This helps ensure the type check at compile time for different possibilities, preventing runtime errors.

Intersection types (A & B) combine multiple types into one, requiring a variable to have properties from all involved types. This is useful for creating complex objects that share properties from different interfaces, ensuring comprehensive type-checking.

Both will allow for more expressive, flexible, and safer code, as complex data is modeled accurately and type constraints are enforced.
